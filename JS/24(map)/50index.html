    <h1>Hoisting</h1>
    <pre>Hoisting refers to the process whereby IN the interpreter appears to to move the declarations to the top of
        the code before execution Variables can thus be referenced before they
        are declared in JavaScript

    Important Note: JavaScript only hoists declarations Not initializations. The variable will be undefined until
    the line where where its its initialized is reached.
