    <h1>Closures</h1>
    <pre>A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with eferences to its
        surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer
        function's scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function
        created, at function creation time.</pre>
