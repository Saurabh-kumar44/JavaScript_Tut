    <h1>Prototype</h1>
    <pre>
    JavaScript objects have a special property called
    prototype that is either null or references another object

    When we try to read a property from a prototype
    and its missing, JavaScript automatically takes it
    from the prototype . This This is is called called "prototypal inheritance "

    Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property, which is called its prototype.
